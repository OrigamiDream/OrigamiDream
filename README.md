## I'm a Machine Learning Engineer

🖥 I only use  devices. (If you can see the emoji, you are also  user!)

🧠 I am trying to figure out main principles of human brain connectome.

📖 I have developed sLLMs which are specialized in Medicine, and **outperformed ChatGPT**.

😎 I am a **Moderator with Helpful Medal** on the Largest [TensorFlow Discord](https://discord.gg/KNm5Epj) community in the world.
