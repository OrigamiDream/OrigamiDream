## I'm a Machine Learning Researcher

🖥 I only use  devices. (If you can see the emoji, you are also  user!)

✈️ I hope to be a Machine Learning Engineer in the future.

🧠 I have a little knowledge in Neuroscience. The most interested part is CA1 area in Hippocampus!

📖 I am currently learning about Meta-Learning such as [Reptile](https://openai.com/research/reptile), [MAML](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400).

😎 I am a Moderator with Helpful Medal on the Largest [TensorFlow Discord](https://discord.gg/KNm5Epj) community in the world.
